title: I'm migrating from Hexo to VuePress
---

To take use of new technologies such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), I am now working on migrating this site from [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) to [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

Also, I decided to abandon [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and start using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), for its outstanding service and seemless integration with GitHub.
